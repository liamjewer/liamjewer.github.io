It would be a safe assumption you’ve heard the name David Ayres in the news this week. After losing both Peter Mrazek and James Reimer to injuries in the first and second Period. David Ayres, the 42 year old zamboni driver for the Marlies was forced into action midway through the second period. Ayres stopped 8 of the 10 shots he faced. After the 6-3 victory over the Maple Leafs, the mayor of North Carolina was vouching to make him an honorary citizen of the city. Ayres has been invited to spend time with players, watch games and get paid for all he did for their team.

If you live in the Waterloo Region you know our spring season is creeping up fast. It’s time to hang those skates and skis up , because it’s time to get the bikes down. From cycling to bmx and mountain biking, the list goes on. However you ride, you know how much fun it can be. Personally, I myself hit the trails. Up hill, down hill, through mud, through water, trudging snow or simply on the open road. I’ll be on the trails and I hope to see you there.

From country to country, teams are gearing up for the UEFA champions league round of 16. From Liverpool, to PSG, Barcelona, Bayern, the list goes on. Many teams are looking to knock off the defending champions Liverpool. It is going to be an interesting few weeks, where we will see both happy and heartbroken fans in the same stadium. My prediction for the Champions League final as of right now is Liverpool vs. PSG. Both sides have looked deadly in their respective leagues. I expect them to continue it in the UEFA champions league tournament.
