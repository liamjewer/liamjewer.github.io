      <h1 class="Title">Disadvantages For Canada</h1>
      <p class="MainInfo-Paragraph">
      	There are many disadvantages to having a diverse nation. Economically, this can cause major problems due to taxation. People are outraged because their tax dollars are going to immigrants. Some of the immigrants, due to their different skill sets may be seen as taking opportunities - such as education (university programs), jobs, and others - away from canadians. A big disadvantage economically is population -  urban sprawl is increasing, meaning more apartment buildings are going up because of rising population levels. This causes money to be spent and more electricity to be used.
        <br>
        <br>
        Socially, diversity can cause racism, especially islamophobia. This is because of a person's natural instinct to judge someone after they see them. When someone sees somebody from a different background they may assume things about them. This causes tension in the social area of Canada's citizens, and can also cause conflicts and attacks. Population increase means more traffic, causing stress in people's lives. Language barriers can be a problem, because if you need to communicate with somebody and you can't understand each other, this can cause issues.
        <br>
        <br>
        Politically, the government has to deal with immigration papers and approvals. The people coming into our country may cause terrorism, and this is a huge issue the government tries to prevent. Some say we are losing our Canadian identity due to more and more immigrants. Job loss because of different skill sets is not only economical, but also political, as the government has to deal with taxation problems due to job loss. Some immigrants may need special attention because of issues in the countries they came from.
        <br>
        <br>
        Environmentally, immigrants could bring in pets that are invasive species. These invasive species invade ecosystems and eliminate the native species. Sickness can also be brought over which canadian doctors arenâ€™t familiar with, or know how to deal with, because it isn't usually found in canadians. If these illnesses are contagious, they could spread throughout Canada impacting the health of canadians. These concerns are why we need to be careful and check people at the border.
