      <h1 class="Title">Advantages For Canada</h1>
      <p class="MainInfo-Paragraph">
      	There are many advantages to multiculturalism in Canada. Socially, we are seen as a more welcoming and multicultural country due to people visiting and noticing the diversity in our society. These people then go back to their home countries and tell others about Canada's welcoming attitude and multiculturalism. Multiculturalism allows Canadians to try foods and traditions from around the world such as sushi and Oktoberfest. The spread of religion in canada can positively affect people's lives by giving them something to believe in. Immigrants to Canada bring different clothing styles with them, this causes fashion trends and style changes. Music and art is brought over from other countries, people bring their songs, paintings, instruments, and so much more to do with art and music.
		<br>
		<br>
		Politically, diversity is also shown in our government. History is a huge factor in why Canada is diverse, such as the underground railroad and providing job opportunities for immigrants. The diversity in Canada allows for tourism and new vacation spots for canadians,  due to immigrants bringing pictures from back home. People see these pictures and think, “wow, that would be a cool vacation spot, I want to go there!”There are many architecture styles in Canada, some of which originated in other countries because architects have immigrated  here and integrated their style into the design. This could also be due to architects seeing buildings from other countries and designing buildings inspired by them. 
		<br>
		<br>
		There are huge economic gains resulting from immigration and diversity. Immigrants are often willing to do jobs canadians don't necessarily want to do,  expanding our workforce. People from other countries have different skill sets and work experience in jobs that Canadians don't have. Companies get people who are better at doing the job, getting it done quicker and better. Along with these skills and jobs, immigrants bring amazing ideas that help our economy and our way of life. These jobs, skills, and ideas bring loads and loads of money into the economy!
		<br>
		<br>
		Environmentally, people from other countries have more respect for plants and gardening. This is great, because our environment is positively affected, more trees means less carbon dioxide and that helps to reduce climate change.
