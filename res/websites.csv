res/websites/SiteStart.png|SiteStart|Created in 2017, SiteStart was my first attempt at a web development business concept. The site features a light theme and lime green accents. It features a super simple design, including 5 pages: “Home”, “About”, “Quotes”, “Previous Sites”, and “Our Team”. The home page is purely used for navigation to the four other pages. The About page consists of a very brief explanation of the company. The Quotes page consists of a contact form where users fill out information about the site they want created. The Previous Sites page shares the sites created by SiteStart.  However, since the business never actually started, there are a few filler sites with random text to test the search functionality (Since then, I have learned that just using filters is a much simpler way to search through sites). The Our Team page is exactly what is to be expected, it displays a picture and upon hover, a description of each team member.|archive/sitestart|business developer
